Feb 28:  We called my friend tanner today who agreed to be the product owner and guiding vision for our project. 
        He came up with some good ideas like being able to place ships, special abilities for ships, and a turn based
        system. He also came up with some bad and rediculous ideas like making it a drinking game and basing the gameplay
        off of waterworld and the movie battleship.
        
March 2: Had to cancel the meeting with paul today because my battleaxe of a laptop died. LIVE FREE MY FRIEND. 
        YOU WILL BE MISSED. Also begrudgingly ordered new laptop.
        
March 3: Met with paul to discuss our presentation and got our skeleton outline made.
